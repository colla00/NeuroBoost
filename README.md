# NeuroBoost: Interactive Platform for Cognitive Enhancement

An interactive platform for cognitive enhancement with neuroscience-backed games and educational content.

## Project Overview

**Inspiration**  
The idea for NeuroBoost stemmed from our fascination with the brainâ€™s ability to learn and adapt. We wanted to create a platform that makes neuroscience accessible and engaging, helping users enhance their cognitive skills through interactive exercises.

**What It Does**  
- **Boost Memory & Focus**: Interactive exercises to strengthen cognitive abilities.
- **Learn About Neuroscience**: Modules on cognitive enhancement, brain function, and ethical considerations.
- **Track Progress**: Personalized performance tracking to highlight growth and improvements.
- **Engage with the Community**: Users can challenge friends, share achievements, and discuss topics in cognitive science.

**Built With**  
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python, JavaScript, React
- **Machine Learning Models**: TensorFlow for adaptive difficulty
- **APIs**: Web Speech API for voice interactions
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase for user data storage
